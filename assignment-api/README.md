# Ágora API Project

## Description

This is the Ágora API project built with NestJS. The API provides various functionalities including user authentication and profile management.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js (>= 12.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm (>= 6.x)](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn (>= 1.x)](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker (>= 20.x)](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose Plugin (>= 2.0.0)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To download the project, clone it from the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone  && cd assignment-api
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project by copying from the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure you update the `.env` file with any necessary configuration values.

### Install Dependencies

You can install the project dependencies using either npm or yarn.

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Project

### Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

We use this method to separate concerns between the database and the application itself. This way, you can run MongoDB in a container while developing the NestJS application locally with live reload for faster development cycles. This approach provides flexibility and efficiency during development.

> **Note:** If you are using an older version of Docker (before version 20.x or without the Docker Compose plugin), the command `docker compose` may not work. In that case, use `docker-compose` instead. Ensure your Docker version is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Start MongoDB using Docker Compose**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d mongo-db
    ```

2. **Run the NestJS application locally**

   Ensure your `.env` file has the correct MongoDB connection string (`MONGO_URL`).
    ```bash
    yarn start:dev
    ```

   You can also choose to run both MongoDB and the NestJS application using Docker:

3. **Start all services using Docker Compose**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Alternatively, you can run MongoDB in Docker and the NestJS application locally using your terminal as described above. This provides the benefit of live reload for the NestJS application.

### Running without Docker

If you prefer to run MongoDB and the NestJS application locally without Docker, make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

1. **Start MongoDB Locally**

   Ensure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017. If you have MongoDB installed, you can start it using:

    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

2. **Run the NestJS application**

    ```bash
    yarn start:dev
    ```

## Available Commands

The project includes several `npm`/`yarn` scripts for development and deployment. Below is an explanation of each command in the `package.json` file:

### General Commands

- **`yarn build`**:
  Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript, generating a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.

- **`yarn start`**:
  Starts the compiled application from the `dist` folder in production mode.

- **`yarn start:dev`**:
  Starts the application in development mode with hot-reloading enabled. Useful for local development.

- **`yarn start:prod`**:
  Starts the application in production mode. This is typically used for deployment.

- **`yarn test`**:
  Runs the application's unit tests using Jest.

- **`yarn format`**:
  Formats all TypeScript files in the `src` and `test` directories using Prettier.

- **`yarn lint`**:
  Lints the codebase using ESLint and fixes any auto-fixable issues.

### Console Commands

- **`yarn console`**:
  Opens the NestJS console environment, allowing you to run commands directly within the application context.

- **`yarn console seed`**:
  Runs the seeding process to populate the database with initial data, including the wildcard user (`developer@example.com` / `dev123`).

## Useful Docker Commands and Further Reading

If you're new to Docker or need a refresher, here are some of the most useful Docker commands:

- **Start services defined in docker-compose.yml**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

- **Stop all running containers**
    ```bash
    docker stop $(docker ps -q)
    ```

- **Remove all containers**
    ```bash
    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
    ```

- **Remove all images**
    ```bash
    docker rmi $(docker images -q)
    ```

- **Clean up the system (remove all unused containers, networks, images, and optionally, volumes)**
    ```bash
    docker system prune -a --volumes
    ```

- **Build an image from a Dockerfile**
    ```bash
    docker build -t <image_name> .
    ```

- **Run a container from an image**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
    ```

- **List all running containers**
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

- **Stop a running container**
    ```bash
    docker stop <container_id>
    ```

- **Remove a stopped container**
    ```bash
    docker rm <container_id>
    ```

- **List all images**
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

- **Remove an image**
    ```bash
    docker rmi <image_id>
    ```

- **View container logs**
    ```bash
    docker logs <container_id>
    ```
